INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT

The final project simulates an assembly line, which fulfils customer orders using processors that perform tasks of adding and removing specific items according to customer specifications and quality control inspections.

The complete solution is built in four milestones followed by a test suite:

Tasks - handles each task of the assembly line
Customer Orders - handles each customer order passing through the assembly line
Managers - manages the tasks, customer orders and items passing through the assembly line
Assembly Line - manages the processors that constitute the assembly line
Test Suite - executes the assembly line simulator for realistic data
A customer places an order for certain items to be included in their final product.  The order may include multiples of the same item.  The assembly line fills the order based on the items available to its processors.  Each processor (or task) is preset to either adding or removing a specific item.  Each processor can fulfil its part of the order through a number of slots.  Each slot can process one customer item request in the customer order at that slot at a time.  If a customer order contains more requests for the same item than the number of slots in the processor, the processor only fills the number of requests equal to the number of slots.

The Figure below illustrates the flow of customer orders through the processors of the assembly line.  If the customer has ordered an item handled by the current processor, that processor adds that item to the product.  An inspector may optionally evaluate the product and decide whether to pass the product to the next processor or to redirect the product to the processor that removes the faulty item.
